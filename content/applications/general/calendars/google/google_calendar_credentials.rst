Synchronize Google Calendar with Odoo

Setup in Google
===============

Select (or create) a project
----------------------------

Create a new Google API project and enable the Google Calendar API. First, go to the
`Google API Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`_ and log into the Google account.

.. note::
   If this is the first time visiting this page, Google will prompt the user to enter a country and
   agree to the Terms of Service. Select a country from the drop-down list and agree to the
   :abbr:`ToS (Terms of Service)`.

Next, click :guilabel:`Select a project` and select (or create) an API project to configure OAuth
in, and store credentials. Click :guilabel:`New Project`.

.. tip::
   Give the API Project a clear name, like "Odoo Sync", so it can be easily identified.

Enable Google calendar API
--------------------------

Now, click on :guilabel:`Enabled APIs and Services` in the left menu. Select :guilabel:`Enabled APIs
and Services` again if the :guilabel:`Search bar` doesn't appear.

After that, search for *Google Calendar API* using the search bar and select :guilabel:`Google
Calendar API` from the search results. Click :guilabel:`Enable`.

OAuth consent screen
--------------------

Now that the API project has been created, OAuth should be configured. To do that, click on
:guilabel:`OAuth consent` in the left menu and then select the :guilabel:`User Type`.

.. warning::
   Personal Gmail Accounts are only allowed to be :guilabel:`External` User Type, which means
   Google may require an approval, or for :guilabel:`Scopes` to be added on. Using a Google
   WorkSpace account allows for :guilabel:`Internal` User Type. It should also be noted that, while
   the API connection is in the :guilabel:`External` :guilabel:`Testing` mode, then no approval is
   necessary from Google. User limits in this :guilabel:`Testing` mode is set to 100 users.

In the second step, :guilabel:`OAuth Consent Screen`, type *Odoo* in the :guilabel:`App name`
field, select the email address for the :guilabel:`User support email` field, and type the email
address for the :guilabel:`Developer contact information` section. Then, click :guilabel:`Save
and Continue`.

Skip the third step, :guilabel:`Scopes`, by clicking :guilabel:`Save and Continue`.

Next, if continuing in testing mode (External), add the email addresses being configured under the
:guilabel:`Test users` step, by clicking on :guilabel:`Add Users`, and then the :guilabel:`Save and
Continue` button. A summary of the :guilabel:`App registration` appears.

Finally, scroll to the bottom, and click on :guilabel:`Back to Dashboard`.

Now, the OAuth consent has been configured, and it's time to create credentials.

Create credentials
------------------

The **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** are both needed to connect Google Calendar to Odoo. This
is the last step in the Google console. Begin by clicking :guilabel:`Credentials` in the left menu.
Then, click :guilabel:`Create Credentials`, and select :guilabel:`OAuth client ID`, Google will open
a guide to create credentials.

Under :guilabel:`OAuth Client ID`, select :guilabel:`Website application` for the
:guilabel:`Application Type` field, and type *My Odoo Database* for the :guilabel:`Name`.

  - Under the :guilabel:`Authorized JavaScript Origins` section, click :guilabel:`+ Add URI` and
    type the company's Odoo full :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` address.

  - Under the :guilabel:`Authorized redirect URIs` section, click :guilabel:`+ Add URI` and type
    the company's Odoo :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` address followed by
    ``/google_account/authentication``. Finally, click :guilabel:`Create`.

A :guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret` will appear, copy these to a notepad.

Setup in Odoo
=============

Once the Client ID and the Client Secret are located, open the Odoo database and go to
:menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings --> Integrations --> Google Calendar`. Check the box
next to :guilabel:`Google Calendar`.

Next, copy and paste the Client ID and the Client Secret from the Google Calendar API Credentials
page into their respective fields below the :guilabel:`Google Calendar` checkbox. Then, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

Sync Calendar in Odoo
=====================

Finally, open the Calendar module in Odoo and click on the :guilabel:`Google` sync button to sync
Google Calendar with Odoo.

.. note::
   When syncing Google Calendar with Odoo for the first time, the page will redirect to the Google
   Account. From there, select the :menuselection:`Email Account` that should have access -->
   :menuselection:`Continue` (should the app be unverifed) --> :menuselection:`Continue` (to give
   permission for the transfer of data).

.. image:: google_calendar_credentials/trust-odoo.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Give Odoo permission to access Google Calendar.

Now, Odoo Calendar is successfully synced with Google Calendar!

.. warning::
   Odoo highly recommends testing the Google calendar synchronization on a test database and a
   test email address (that is not used for any other purpose) before attempting to sync the
   desired Google Calendar with the user's production database.

   Once a user synchronizes their Google calendar with the Odoo calendar:

   - Creating an event in Odoo causes Google to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Deleting an event in Odoo causes Google to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Adding a contact to an event causes Google to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Removing a contact from an event causes Google to send a cancellation to all event attendees.

   Events can be created in Google Calendar without sending a notification by selecting
   :guilabel:`Don't Send` when prompted to send invitation emails.
