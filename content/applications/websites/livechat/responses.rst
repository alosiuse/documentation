=============================
Commands and canned responses
=============================

In the Odoo *Live Chat* application, *Commands* allow the user to perform specific actions both
inside the chat window, and through other Odoo applications. The *Live Chat* app also includes
*Canned Responses*. These are customized, pre-configured substitutions that allow users to replace
shortcut entries in place of longer, well-thought out responses to some of the most common
questions and comments.

Both *commands* and *canned responses* save time, and allow users to maintain a level of
consistency throughout their conversations.

Execute a command
=================

Live chat *commands* are keywords that triggers pre-configured actions. When a live chat *operator*
is participating in a conversation with a customer or visitor, they can execute a command by typing
`/` followed by the command.

Commands, and the resulting actions, will only be visible in the conversation window for a live
chat operator. A customer will not see any commands entered on their end of the chat.

Helpdesk & Helpdesk search
--------------------------

The `/helpdesk` and `/helpdesk_search` commands allow operators to both create :guilabel:`Helpdesk`
tickets directly from a conversation, and search through existing tickets by keyword or ticket
number.

.. important::
   - The `/helpdesk` and `/helpdesk_search` commands can only be used if the :guilabel:`Helpdesk`
     app has been installed, and :guilabel:`Live Chat` has been activated on a :guilabel:`Helpdesk
     Team`. To activate :guilabel:`Live Chat`, go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk application -->
     Configuration --> Teams`, and select a team. Scroll to the :guilabel:`Channels` section and
     check the box labeled :guilabel:`Live Chat`.

Create a ticket from a live chat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an operator types `/helpdesk` in the chat window, the conversation is used to create a
:guilabel:`Helpdesk Ticket`.

After entering the `/helpdesk` command, select a title for the ticket and type it into the chat
window, then press `Enter`.

.. image:: responses/live-chat-helpdesk.png

The newly created ticket will be added to the :guilabel:`Helpdesk` team that has live chat enabled.
If there is more than one team with live chat enabled, the ticket will automatically be assigned
based on the team's priority.

The transcript from the conversation will be added to the new ticket, under the
:guilabel:`Description` tab.

To view the new ticket, click on the link in the chat window. or go to
:menuselection:`Helpdesk app` and click the :guilabel:`Tickets` button on the kanban card for
the appropriate team.

Search for a ticket from a live chat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an operator types `/helpdesk_search` in the chat window, they can search through
:guilabel:`Helpdesk` tickets by ticket number or keyword.

After entering the `/helpdesk_search` command, type a keyword or ticket number, then press `Enter`.
If a related ticket is found, a link will be generated in the conversation window.

History
-------

If an operator types `/history` in the chat window, it will generate a list of the most recent
pages the visitor has viewed on the website (up to 15).

Lead
----

By typing `/lead` in the chat window, an operator can create a :guilabel:`Lead` in the
:guilabel:`CRM` application. After typing `/lead`, create a title for this new lead, then press
`Enter`.

The `/lead` command can only be used if the :guilabel:`CRM` app has been installed. To access the
:guilabel:`lead`, click on the link in the chat window, or navigate to the :menuselection:`CRM app`
to view the :guilabel:`Pipeline`.

The transcript of the conversation is added to the :guilabel:`Internal Notes` tab of the
lead form. On the :guilabel:`Extra Information` tab of the lead form, the :guilabel:`Source` will
be listed as :guilabel:`Livechat`.

-----

If an operator types `/leave` in the chat window, they can automatically exit the conversation.

Canned responses
================

*Canned responses* are customizable inputs where a shortcut stands in for a longer response. An
operator will enter the :guilabel:`Shortcut`, and it will automatically be replaced by the expanded
:guilabel:`Substitution` response in the conversation.

Create canned responses
-----------------------

To create a new :guilabel:`Canned Response`, go to :menuselection:`Live Chat app --> Configuration
--> Canned Responses --> New`.

From here, choose a :guilabel:`Shortcut` and enter it into the :guilabel:`Shortcut` field.

Then, click into the :guilabel:`Substitution` field, and enter the custom message that will be sent
to visitors in place of the :guilabel:`Shortcut`. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   Try to connect the :guilabel:`Shortcut` to the topic of the :guilabel:`Substitution`. The easier
   it is for the *operators* to remember, the easier it will be to use the *canned responses* in
   conversations.

Use canned responses in a live chat conversation
------------------------------------------------

To use a *Canned response* during a live chat conversation, type a colon (`:`)  into the chat
window, followed by the shortcut.

.. example::
   An operator is chatting with a visitor. As soon as they type `:` they would see a list of
   available responses. They can manually select one from the list, or continue to type. If they
   want to use the the canned response *'I am sorry to hear that.'*, they would type `:sorry`.

.. tip::
   Typing `:` into a chat window on its own will generate a list of available canned responses.
   Responses can be manually selected from the list, in addition to the use of shortcuts.
