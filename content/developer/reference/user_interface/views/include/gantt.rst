Gantt views appropriately display Gantt charts (for scheduling).

The root element of gantt views is ``<gantt/>``, it has no children but can
take the following attributes_:

:string:
  string_ (optional)

  View name

:create:
  boolean_ (optional)

  Disable/enable record creation on the view.

:edit:
  boolean_ (optional)

  Disable/enable record editing on the view.

:delete:
  boolean_ (optional)

  Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``date_start`` (required)
  name of the field providing the start datetime of the event for each
  record.
``date_stop`` (required)
  name of the field providing the end duration of the event for each
  record.
``dependency_field``
  name of the ``many2many`` field that provides the dependency relation between two records.
  If B depends on A, ``dependency_field`` is the field that allows getting A
  from B. Both this field and ``dependency_inverted_field`` field are used to
  draw dependency arrows between pills and reschedule them.
``dependency_inverted_field`` (required if ``dependency_field`` is provided)
  name of the ``many2many`` field that provides the invert dependency relation than
  ``dependency_field``. If B depends on A, ``dependency_inverted_field`` is
  the field that allows getting B from A.
``color``
  name of the field used to color the pills according to its value
``decoration-{$name}``
  `python expression`_ that defines a boolean_

  allow changing the style of a cell's text based on the corresponding
  record's attributes.

  ``{$name}`` can be one of the following `bootstrap contextual color`_ (``danger``,
  ``info``, ``secondary``, ``success`` or ``warning``).

  Define a conditional display of a record in the style of a row's text based on the corresponding
  record's attributes.

  Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is evaluated
  with the record's attributes as context values and if ``true``, the
  corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some of the other values
  available in the context:

  * ``uid``: the id of the current user,
  * ``today``: the current local date as a string of the form ``YYYY-MM-DD``,
  * ``now``: same as ``today`` with the addition of the current time.
    This value is formatted as ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss``.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <gantt decoration-info="state == 'draft'"
          decoration-danger="state == 'help_needed'"
          decoration-bf="state == 'busy'">
      ...
    </gantt>
``default_group_by``
  name of a field to group tasks by
``disable_drag_drop``
  if set to true, the gantt view will not have any drag&drop support
``consolidation``
  field name to display consolidation value in record cell
``consolidation_max``
  dictionary with the "group by" field as key and the maximum consolidation
  value that can be reached before displaying the cell in red
  (e.g. ``{"user_id": 100}``)
``consolidation_exclude``
  name of the field that describes if the task has to be excluded
  from the consolidation
  if set to true it displays a striped zone in the consolidation line
``create``, ``cell_create``, ``edit``, ``delete``, ``plan``
    allows *dis*\ abling the corresponding action in the view by setting the
    corresponding attribute to ``false`` (default: ``true``).

    * ``create``: If enabled, an ``Add`` button will be available in the control
      panel to create records.
    * ``cell_create``: If enabled and ``create`` enabled, a "**+**" button will be
      displayed while hovering on a time slot cell to create a new record on that slot.
    * ``edit``: If enabled, the opened records will be in edit mode (thus editable).
    * ``plan``: If enabled and ``edit`` enabled, a "magnifying glass" button will be displayed
      on time slots to plan unassigned records into that time slot.

    .. example::

        When you do not want to create records on the gantt view and the beginning and end
        dates are required on the model, the planning feature should be disabled
        because no record will ever be found.
``offset``
  Depending on the scale, the number of units to add to today to compute the
  default period. Examples: An offset of +1 in default_scale week will open the
  gantt view for next week, and an offset of -2 in default_scale month will open
  the gantt view of 2 months ago.
``progress``
  name of a field providing the completion percentage for the record's event,
  between 0 and 100
``string``
  title of the gantt view
``precision``
  JSON object specifying snapping precisions for the pills in each scale.

  Possible values for scale ``day`` are (default: ``hour``):

  - ``hour``: records times snap to full hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 8:00)

  - ``hour:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:30)

  - ``hour:quarter``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:15)

  Possible values for scale ``week`` are (default: ``day:half``):

  - ``day``: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  - ``day:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)

  Possible values for scale ``month`` are (default: ``day:half``):

  - ``day``: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  - ``day:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)

  Scale ``year`` always snap to full day.

  Example of precision attribute: ``{"day": "hour:quarter", "week": "day:half", "month": "day"}``
``total_row``
  boolean to control whether the row containing the total count of records should
  be displayed. (default: ``false``)
``collapse_first_level``
  boolean to control whether it is possible to collapse each row if grouped by
  one field. (default: ``false``, the collapse starts when grouping by two fields)
``display_unavailability``
  boolean to mark the dates returned by the ``gantt_unavailability`` function of
  the model as available inside the gantt view. Records can still be scheduled
  in them, but their unavailability is visually displayed. (default: ``false``)
``default_scale``
  default scale when rendering the view. Possible values are (default: ``month``):

  * ``day``
  * ``week``
  * ``month``
  * ``year``

``scales``
  comma-separated list of allowed scales for this view. By default, all scales
  are allowed. For possible scale values to use in this list, see ``default_scale``.

``templates``
  defines the :ref:`reference/qweb` template ``gantt-popover`` which is used
  when the user hovers over one of the records in the gantt view.

  The gantt view uses mostly-standard :ref:`javascript qweb
  <reference/qweb/javascript>` and provides the following context variables:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``widget``
    the current :js:class:`GanttRow`, can be used to fetch some
    meta-information. The ``getColor`` method to convert in a color integer is
    also available directly in the template context without using ``widget``.

  ``on_create``
    If specified when clicking the add button on the view, instead of opening a generic dialog, launch a client action.
    this should hold the xmlid of the action (eg: ``on_create="%(my_module.my_wizard)d"``

``form_view_id``
  view to open when the user create or edit a record. Note that if this attribute
  is not set, the gantt view will fall back to the id of the form view in the
  current action, if any.

``dynamic_range``
  if set to true, the gantt view will start at the first record,
  instead of starting at the beginning of the year/month/day.

``pill_label``
  If set to true, the time appears in the pill label when the scale is set on week or month. (e.g.
  `7:00 AM - 11:00 AM (4h) - DST Task 1`)

``thumbnails``
  This allows to display a thumbnail next to groups name if the group is a relationnal field.
  This expects a python dict which keys are the name of the field on the active model.
  Values are the names of the field holding the thumbnail on the related model.

  Example: tasks have a field user_id that reference res.users. The res.users model has a field image that holds the avatar,
  then:

  .. code-block:: xml

     <gantt
        date_start="date_start"
        date_stop="date_stop"
        thumbnails="{'user_id': 'image_128'}"
      >
      </gantt>

  will display the users avatars next to their names when grouped by user_id.
